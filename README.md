# Web Dev for Cog Sci Research Labs

## Description of Yoshimi lab

Yoshimi lab is an interdisciplinary research lab that combines computing skills and cognitive science principles to explore in the following area: new ways of visualizing complex neural activities (i.e. Simbrain Project), user experience in citizen games (i.e. Eterna UX project), etc. 

## Description of the project

The website will be built with multiple pages to **display information** about research labs and **design** it to be professional-looking and **viewer-friendly**. Information displayed on the website should include, but not limited to the description of on-going projects, introduction of group members, and presentation of past findings. The final website will be hosted under the official UCM domain, so it will need to **suffice requirements of the web development requested by UCM**. The final design of the website needs to be approved by the specific professor, so you will need to attend **bi-weekly meetings** with the professor to understand what exactly does he desire. 

###### You donâ€™t need to:

+  Storing user data (i.e. Log-in or dashboard)
+  Maintain it after the project has been completed. (Of course, you are welcome to maintain the website, but it is not required.) 
+  Be a part of the regular lab business, or fully understand everything the lab is doing. 

###### You will get: 

-  A good hands-on web development project on your resume
-  Great networking opportunity with professors in cognitive science field 
-  A letter of recommendation (by request)
